# Italian Dialect Translator

### Your idea in a nutshell
An AI-powered mobile application designed to translate various Italian dialects into standard Italian (and vice versa) in real-time.

### Background
Italy has hundreds of dialects, but younger generations are losing them. This project aims to preserve cultural heritage and help elderly people communicate with younger generations or tourists.

### Data and AI techniques
* Data: Speech and text datasets in regional dialects (Neapolitan, Sicilian, etc.).
* Techniques: Speech-to-Text and Neural Machine Translation (NMT).

### How is it used
In daily life, travels, or public offices. It helps preserve the local identity while ensuring everyone understands each other.

### Challenges
Capturing local idioms and managing dialects that don't have a standardized written form.

### What next
Expanding to include voice lessons to help people learn how to speak the dialects correctly.

### Acknowledgments
Inspired by the "Elements of AI" course.

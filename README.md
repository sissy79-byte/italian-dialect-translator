# Italian Dialect Translator

## Summary
This project is an AI-based tool designed to translate various Italian dialects into standard Italian. It aims to preserve regional linguistic heritage and help people understand local expressions through a digital translator.

## Background
* Which problem does your idea solve? How common or important is this problem?
* What is your personal motivation?
* Why is this topic important or interesting?

The main problem is the language barrier between generations and regions in Italy. Many dialects are disappearing, and this tool helps maintain the cultural identity of different Italian regions.

## Data and AI methods
I plan to use a dataset of dialectal words and phrases paired with their Italian equivalents. For the AI part, I will start with a simple dictionary lookup and then move towards a more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach.

## Goals
The goal is to create a functional prototype that can recognize and translate basic sentences from at least one or two specific Italian dialects (like Romanesco or Neapolitan) into standard Italian.
